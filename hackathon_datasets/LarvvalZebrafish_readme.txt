Description - 
Larval zebrafish (7 days post-fertilization) freely swimming in a petry dish with prey (paramecia).
Images are background-subtracted and cropped around the fish.
Only intervals with swimming bouts are included.

Original frame rate - 
300 Hz

Important features -

* Tail shape during swimming
* Eye angles with respect to the body axis (fish perform conjugate saccades during exploratory swimming and convergent saccades upon initiation of hunting)
* Pectoral fin movements (almost never tracked before)

Potential further analysis -

* Correlated movements of eyes, tail and pectoral fins
* Cluster of swim bout types, taking into account eye positions
